- [ ] Create Railway project with MySQL database

- [ ] Create MySQL service in project
- [ ] Deploy application to Railway
- [ ] Configure all environment variables
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Set up Telegram webhook

## Bug Fixes
- [x] Fix infinite loading spinner in Telegram Mini App (auth flow stuck on "Загрузка...")
- [x] Fix "Failed to create or retrieve user" error in Telegram auth flow
- [ ] Fix persistent "Authentication failed" error - Telegram initData validation failing on Railway

## New Feature Requests
- [ ] Limit users to one family budget (cannot create if already in a group)
- [x] Default all transactions to family budget when user has a family group
- [x] Limit users to one family budget (cannot create if already in a group)

## Bug Fixes (Round 2)
- [x] Fix reports tab showing empty data
- [x] Fix main balance showing 0 despite having transactions
- [x] Fix language switching not working (interface stays in Russian)

## New Features (Round 2)
- [x] New professional logo (clean, modern, finance-oriented, not casino-like)
- [x] Default budget preference setting (personal vs family toggle that persists)
- [x] Receipt/screenshot recognition via vision AI (camera capture, OCR parsing, auto-fill transaction)

## Bug Fixes (Round 3)
- [x] Fix reports time filter broken (7d/30d/etc show zero data, only "All" works)
- [x] Fix category names not translating when language is switched
- [x] Fix receipt scanner only saves first transaction (need multi-transaction + duplicate detection)

## Bug Fixes (Round 4)
- [x] Fix reports time filter ROOT CAUSE (7d/30d return empty for real user — investigate actual dates in production DB)
  Root cause: LLM was returning dates in seconds, stored as-is. Filter compared ms vs s. Fixed with normalizeTimestampMs() + startup migration.

## Bug Fixes (Round 5)
- [x] Fix reports time filter for REAL user (improved threshold from 1e11 to 1e12 to catch all seconds timestamps)
- [x] Add family budget shared reports with 3 filters: My expenses / Partner's expenses / All together
